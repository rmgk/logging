= Logging
Ragnar Mogk, 2018-02-13, v0.1.0

Sometimes, I want to log some text.

Sometimes, I want to log with levels.

Sometimes, I want to log with tags.

Sometimes, I want to log with source lines.

But never do I want to log with XML.

== Usage

The basic interface provides the usual logging methods logging with different
levels.

[source,scala]
----
import de.rmgk.logging.{Logger, Level}

val log = Logger(tag = "Prefixed to the output: ", level = Level.Debug)

log.trace("text")
log.debug("text")
log.info("text")
log.warn("text")
log.error("text")

----

Recommended usage and configuration is to create your own little libraries of
loggers, which can be centrally configured, and use them as you see fit.


[source,scala]
----
import de.rmgk.logging.{Level, Logger}

object Log {

  val common: Logger = de.rmgk.logging.Logger(tag = "", level = Level.Trace, tracing = true)
  val Tool: Logger = common.copy(tag = "Tool: ", level = Level.Info)
  val Main: Logger = common
  val Web: Logger = common.copy(tag = "Web: ", tracing = false)
  val Store: Logger = common.copy(tag = "IO: ")
  val Server: Logger = common.copy(tag = "Serv: ")
}

â€¦

Log.Web.warn("download failed")

object Server {
	import Log.{Server => Log}

	Log.info("This is the server logger")
}

== Contributing

Issues and pull request welcome.

I assume that some more flexible configuration will be needed at some point,
feel free to contribute usecases.
